Make sure you understand and satisfy each of the following technical requirements.

Hardware requirements
---------------------
**Requirements**:

- CPU: Dual core 2.0GHz
- RAM: 2GB (Does not impact the maximum filesize that a platform installation can handle in upload)
- STORAGE: 20GB Allocate more based on data retention policy and (expected) traffic.
- I/O: 10Mbit/s (shared)

Software requirements
---------------------
GlobaLeaks is designed to run on GNU/Linux and  developed and tested specifically for Debian 10 (Buster)

The software lifecycle of the platform includes full support for all Debian and Ubuntu LTS versions starting from Debian 10 and Ubuntu 20.04.

On these platforms the support is guaranteed following the `Release End of Life <https://www.ubuntu.com/info/release-end-of-life>`_ defined by Ubuntu.

Support for more distributions is planned.
